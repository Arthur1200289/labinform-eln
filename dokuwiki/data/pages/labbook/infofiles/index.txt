====== Templates for info files ======

For each experiment performed, a file with the important parameters for the measurement is usually stored, which is saved together with the raw data and read in by the processing routines.

  And here some comments as free text - and as YAML can handle UTF8,
  you can include special characters such as umlauts: äöü
  
  even empty lines are allowed, provided that each line is indented.
