...

  * Small footprint: minimum system requirements, simple installation, no database backend
  * Wiki-based: simple, yet powerful markup; high flexibility
  * Entries are created by web forms and based on templates
  * Inventory: Samples and batches
  * Usually one labbook entry per measurement
  * Measurements are grouped by method
  * Labbook entries contain crucial metadata
  * Labbook entries are cross-referenced from the sample pages
  * Most adjustments can be made from *within* the Web UI


Small footprint
===============

minimum system requirements, simple installation, no database backend


Wiki-based
==========

minimum system requirements, simple installation, no database backend

existing wiki software, battle-proven, much larger user base than any ELN


Web forms and templates
=======================

Entries are created by web forms and based on templates


Inventory for samples
=====================

Inventory: Samples and batches


Grouping by method
==================

Measurements are grouped by method


One page per measurement
========================

Usually one labbook entry per measurement


Metadata and (automatic) cross-referencing
==========================================

  * Labbook entries contain crucial metadata
  * Labbook entries are cross-referenced from the sample pages


Adjustments from within the Web UI
==================================

  * Most adjustments can be made from *within* the Web UI
  * No detailed IT know-how (server, terminal) and no access to the file system necessary
