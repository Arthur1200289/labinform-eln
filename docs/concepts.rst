Concepts
========

The concepts described below are not unique to the LabInform ELN, but in their entirety they make the LabInform ELN standing out from other similar solutions. Thus, they answer the question what makes the LabInform ELN different and why it is worth considering it -- and the underlying principles. As said, concepts are much more important than concrete implementations, as long as they get implemented in a working piece of software.

  * Small footprint: minimum system requirements, simple installation, no database backend
  * Wiki-based: simple, yet powerful markup; high flexibility
  * Entries are created by web forms and based on templates
  * Inventory: Samples and batches
  * Usually one labbook entry per measurement
  * Measurements are grouped by method
  * Labbook entries contain crucial metadata
  * Labbook entries are cross-referenced from the sample pages
  * Most adjustments can be made from *within* the Web UI


Small footprint
===============

minimum system requirements, simple installation, no database backend


Wiki-based
==========

minimum system requirements, simple installation, no database backend

existing wiki software, battle-proven, much larger user base than any ELN


Web forms and templates
=======================

Entries are created by web forms and based on templates


Inventory for samples
=====================

Inventory: Samples and batches

.. note::
    An inventory is not a key component of an ELN. Furthermore, the inventory shown here is mostly restricted to samples and does *not* include consumables in general. Inventories for consumables and particularly for chemicals have some requirements and constraints that are clearly out of scope of the LabInform ELN.


Grouping by method
==================

Measurements are grouped by method


One page per measurement
========================

Usually one labbook entry per measurement


Metadata and (automatic) cross-referencing
==========================================

  * Labbook entries contain crucial metadata
  * Labbook entries are cross-referenced from the sample pages


Adjustments from within the Web UI
==================================

  * Most adjustments can be made from *within* the Web UI
  * No detailed IT know-how (server, terminal) and no access to the file system necessary
