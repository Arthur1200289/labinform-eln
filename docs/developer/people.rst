Who are the people behind the LabInform ELN?

In late 2012, Till Biskup started using DokuWiki as an ELN in a systematic way, with pages for every measurement, and forms to create the individual ELN pages, much in the same way as it is done now. Quickly, other people in the group got interested and got installations by themselves.

In 2019, Mirjam Schr√∂der joined the development team, as she got interested in an ELN based on DokuWiki herself.
