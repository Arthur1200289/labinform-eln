Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1.0
=================

*Initial release*

* Working installation
* Sensible documentation without too large gaps
* Preprint describing LabInform ELN submitted to ChemRxiv


For later versions
==================

* Docker container
* XML-RPC interface towards ASpecD
