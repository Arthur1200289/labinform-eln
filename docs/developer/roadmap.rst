Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For pre-release on Zenodo
=========================

* Sensible documentation without too large gaps
* Demo instance somewhat working (with automatic delete)
* Appropriate README with at least some information besides the license (link to demo instance and documentation)


For version 0.1.0
=================

*Initial release*

* Working installation
* Sensible documentation without too large gaps
* Preprint describing LabInform ELN submitted to ChemRxiv


For later versions
==================

* Docker container
* XML-RPC interface towards ASpecD


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
