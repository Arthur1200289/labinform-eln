Adding a sample to the inventory
================================

One of the operating principles of the LabInform ELN states that every measurement gets performed on a sample. Hence, before you can create a labbook entry (*i.e.*, a dedicated page containing information on a measurement), you should first add a sample to the inventory, in order to reference the sample from the labbook page.

Samples are the object that is investigated, *i.e.* in spectroscopy the entity that is put into the spectrometer.

Each sample, in turn, originates from a batch, as usually, you will prepare the sample in some way or other, before it gets measured.


Creating a labbook entry
========================

The LabInform ELN is organised such that for each measurement on a sample, usually an individual labbook entry is created. To ease creating labbook entries, web forms are provided.
