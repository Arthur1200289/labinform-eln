=========
Use cases
=========

.. note::

    *Internal memo*: The use cases described here should be on a rather abstract level, describing overall tasks to be performed with an ELN, rather than the details of how to achieve these tasks within the LabInform ELN. The latter will be done in the :doc:`user manual <user/index>`.


Ideas for use cases:

  * Document an individual measurement of a sample (*i.e.*, a single labbook entry)
  * Get an overview of all the measurements performed on a particular sample
  * Get an overview of all the measurements performed with a method, sortable and with filtering capabilities
