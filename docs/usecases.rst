Use cases
=========

To give you a first impression of how working with the LabInform ELN may look like and what tasks you can perform using an ELN, a series of high-level use cases is provided. These use cases are informed by the longstanding experience of the authors of the LabInform ELN and hence rooted within the setting of a spectroscopy lab dealing with sometimes rather complex (non-routine) measurements of individual samples.

.. note::

    The use cases described here are on a rather abstract level, describing overall tasks to be performed with an ELN. The details of how to achieve these tasks within the LabInform ELN are provided in the :doc:`user manual <user/index>`.

Overview:

  * Document an individual measurement of a sample (*i.e.*, a single labbook entry)
  * Get an overview of all the measurements performed on a particular sample
  * Get an overview of all the measurements performed with a method, sortable and with filtering capabilities


Document an individual measurement of a sample
==============================================

Documenting individual measurements is at the heart of scientific recordkeeping and has a direct parallel in the analog world of a paper-based lab notebook. To achieve a maximum of reproducibility, you would like to document exactly what has been done. Usually, this includes a series of structured metadata (*e.g.* sample, date, operator, type of measurement, purpose) that can be stored as key--value pairs as well as a detailed chronological protocol of the individual tasks performed and observations made. Furthermore, you can add media (typically images or graphical representations of data) and other information, as well as commments and (first) analyses of the data.

Some of the big advantages of electronic lab notebooks compared to their analog paper-based counterpart include: They can be easily searched, they allow to provide templates for more homogeneous and complete documentation, and they can contain links to the data and other digital research artifacts.


Overview of all measurements performed on one sample
====================================================

Particularly in spectroscopy, you often perform more than one measurement on the same sample, as you intend to get the maximum information and samples can be quite expensive an hence valuable. Therefore, a typical use case is to get an overview of all measurements that have been performed on an individual sample.

Overview of all measurements performed with one method

Ideas for use cases:

  * Document an individual measurement of a sample (*i.e.*, a single labbook entry)
  * Get an overview of all the measurements performed on a particular sample
  * Get an overview of all the measurements performed with a method, sortable and with filtering capabilities

And some use cases for QC calculations:

  * Document an individual calculation on a given geometry of a molecule
  * Get an overview of all calculations performed on a particular geometry
  * Get an overview of all available geometries of a particular molecule
