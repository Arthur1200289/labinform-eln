Adapting
========

There is **no turnkey solution** to electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) **that works out of the box**. Each ELN needs to be adapted to the special needs of the individual scientist or work group. To do so, you need to understand the processes in your lab in a detail that allows you to model them in an electronic workflow such as an ELN.

How does the LabInform ELN help you with this? Due to its very flexible and modular nature, being based on `DokuWiki <https://www.dokuwiki.org/>`_, and the many available plugins you can make it truly your own. Being designed with knowledge management in mind, DokuWiki can be turned into a fully working ELN, as shown here, just using the right set of plugins and a few design principles. The `demo instance <https://eln.labinform.de/>`_ of the LabInform ELN (available at https://eln.labinform.de/) showcases how to model workflows typical for a spectroscopy lab using a digital infrastructure, here an ELN. Purposefully, similar questions are addressed in different ways to show the flexibility of the system.
