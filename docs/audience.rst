Who is the target audience of the LabInform ELN? Is it interesting for me?


Scientists interested in reproducible research
==============================================


Small groups with limited IT support

Spectroscopists
===============

Surely, the LabInform ELN is *not* limited to spectroscopists, but due to the background of its developers, it is mostly used in this context. What does this mean? While on the one hand, there is usually a set of methods available in a single spectroscopy laboratory, it is usually not routine measurements (as in analytics). Hence, every measurement requires some documentation. On the other hand, there is normally a clear relationship between a sample (the object to be investigated) and a measurement that gets documented in the ELN.
